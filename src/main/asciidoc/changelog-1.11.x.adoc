=== 1.11.0

====  New Features
* Filtering support for query logging
(https://github.com/jdbc-observations/datasource-proxy/issues/127[Issue-127]).  +
Thanks _https://github.com/frederikb[Frederik Bülthoff]_ for this contribution!!


====  Improvements
* `ProxyDataSource#close` to unwrap and delegate `close` to underlying `DataSource` if needed (https://github.com/jdbc-observations/datasource-proxy/issues/129[Issue-129]).
+
When `ProxyDataSource#close` is called, and the original `DataSource` does not implement `Closeable` or `AutoCloseable`, the proxy now attempts to unwrap the original `DataSource` to one that does, in order to delegate the `close` call appropriately.
